 in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.

 1. Global Binding - When 'this' is not bound to anything, it will default to the window object.
 2. Implicit Binding - When a property is located inside of an object, it points to the parent object which is usually to the left of the '.' at call time.
 3. Explicit Binding - When we specify what 'this' is using call, apply, bind.
 4. New Binding - When we use a constructor function to create a new object.
